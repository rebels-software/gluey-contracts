# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-08)

**Core value:** Zero-allocation, single-pass validation and indexing of raw bytes against a schema
**Current focus:** Phase 1: Core Types

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 10 (Core Types)
Plan: 1 of 1 completed in current phase
Status: Executing
Last activity: 2026-03-08 — Plan 01-01 executed (leaf types)

Progress: [█░░░░░░░░░] 10%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 1
- Average duration: 4 min
- Total execution time: 0.07 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01-core-types | 1 | 4 min | 4 min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 01-01 (4 min)
- Trend: baseline

*Updated after each plan completion*

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- CORE-07 specifies: TryParse (bool + out) and Parse (returns nullable, never throws) -- NO Result<T> pattern
- All core value types are readonly struct (ADR 8) -- no classes, no record structs, no ref structs
- ParsedProperty offset/length points to content inside quotes -- contract with Phase 4 tokenizer (01-01)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 4: Resolve whether to wrap Utf8JsonReader or build custom JsonByteReader (research gap)
- Phase 8: uniqueItems zero-allocation hashing strategy needs design work
- Phase 8: Format assertion may need small allocation budget (opt-in, outside zero-alloc guarantee)
