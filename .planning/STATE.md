## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 7-phase build order follows dependency chain (format flag -> contract model -> scalars -> leaf types -> composites -> validation -> packaging)
- [Roadmap]: Contract loading and all load-time validation grouped into single phase (Phase 2) since they share the same testable boundary

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Research]: Endianness storage on ParsedProperty (1-byte flag vs normalize at parse time) needs measurement during Phase 1
- [Research]: Enum raw-value naming convention (name+"s" vs "$raw" path) must be decided during Phase 2
